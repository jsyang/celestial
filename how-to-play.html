<p>You begin with either an invasion fleet (1 x Fighter + 4 invasion Freighters) or
a single occupied planet.</p>
<p>To colonize planets, you must land on them when they are unoccupied with your 
Fighter. It will lay a colonization beacon that will start the flow of Freighters 
sent to construct facilities on it. </p>
<p>To win, you need to destroy all enemy production and combat facilities.</p>
<h4 id="landing-on-planets">Landing on planets</h4>
<p>Before colonization can begin, you must land on a planet to secure your colonization
beacon. To do this safely, approach the planet at a slow speed and rotate it to
face outwards from the planet&#39;s center. Failing to do this means your Fighter will
be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>When you land on a friendly planet, your weapons will be rearmed and your ship repaired.</strong></p>
<p>Note: you cannot land on stars. Fighters are affected by gravity from planets and stars. </p>
<h3 id="weapons">Weapons</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cannon</strong><br>The standard energy weapon supplied by the same power plant that drives
a spacecraft&#39;s propulsion system.<br><code>Damage: 1 per hit</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Heavy Cannon</strong><br>Focusing the emitters of the standard cannon allowed us to create a weapon that 
deliver twice the energy per projectile.<br><code>Damage: 2 per hit</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster Rocket</strong><br>Packed with high explosive shells, this unguided rocket can deliver 20
shells to the recipient for maximum destruction.<br><code>Damage: 1 per hit x 20 shells + 0.5 impact damage</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Homing Missile</strong><br>We have developed cheap, miniaturized biological prey-seeking intelligence
that is installed into every mass produced homing missile; a highly destructive weapon.<br><code>Damage: 6 per hit</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Laser Bolt</strong><br>Fast discharge ultra-capacitors have enabled our technicians to pack a devastating laser weapon
into a small space.<br><code>Damage: 30 per hit, ranged</code> </p>

<p>The backbone of an offensive fighting force is the standard GHX-12 Fighter
craft armed with a rapid-fire cannon. Fighters can lay claim to unoccupied
planets.</p>

<p><img src="assets/freighter.png" alt="1"></p>
<p>Transport for raw and finished materials is provided primarily by Freighters.
They carry the capability to speed up construction of the essential 
fortifications and facilities. Freighters are the only craft capable of constructing
a Planetary Base (PBase).</p>

<p>A Planetary Base (PBase) provides a planet with basic production and mining operations.
It can harvest and store raw materials on the planet. It can construct a Communications
Center and a Planetary Lab. It also provides defensive weapons, allowing the planet to </p>
<p>defend itself from attackers. </p>

<p><img src="assets/pcolony.png" alt="1"></p>
<p>A Planetary Colony (PColony) is the most efficient way for a planet to produce finished
materials from raw materials. It can construct spacecraft and other facilities; its operation
is critical to the maintenance demands of a planet. </p>

<p>Galactic scanners installed in the Planetary Communications (PComm) allow
empires to track precise locations of other worlds. A galactic radar display is
active when your faction owns at least one functional PComm.</p>

<p>The orbital Spaceport and its facilities allow the Fighter craft to be swiftly repaired and
rearmed. As it is the first point of defense for a planet, it is heavily armed and armored.  </p>
