game screen:<br /><img src="hud.png" alt="1"><br />(1) -- Galaxy radar is provided by friendly planets with Communications Centers. Markers indicate the positions of planets, stars, and spaceships: green, yellow, and other colors, respectively. You can press M or click on this small display to expand the display to fill your screen.<br />(2) -- Your rank is display along with current progress to next highest rank.<br />(3) -- Spaceship type and damage level <br />(4) -- Active weapon: if the weapon requires an ammo supply, it is shown as a tally underneath the weapon name <br />(5) -- Pointer to nearest star (yellow)<br />(6) -- Pointer to nearest planet (green)<br /><blockquote>A message log is shown at the bottom right corner of the HUD.
As the battle wages on, you will receive progress messages here from the parts of your faction's
war machine. Most recent messages are displayed at towards the top, leaving older messages to drop off below.</blockquote><h2>Game play</h2>You begin with either an invasion fleet (1 x Fighter + 4 invasion Freighters) or
a single occupied planet.<br />To colonize planets, you must land on them when they are unoccupied with your 
Fighter. The landing will plant a beacon, starting the flow of Freighters 
and raw materials sent to construct facilities on the planet. <br />To win, you need to destroy all enemy production, combat facilities, and spacecraft.<h3>Landing on planets</h3>Before colonization can begin, you must land on a planet to secure your colonization
beacon. Approach the planet at slow speed and rotate the craft to face outwards from 
the planet's center. A landing speed indicator will be shown as you approach the planet.
Failing to correctly orient and slow the Fighter will destroy it on contact with the planet's
surface.<br /><strong>When you land on a friendly planet, your weapons will be rearmed and your ship repaired.</strong><br />Note: you cannot land on stars. Fighters are affected by gravity from both planets and stars. <h3>Landing on a friendly spaceport</h3>Much like landing on a planet, you must approach the spaceport slowly and aim for the center of
the spaceport to trigger the docking sequence. Once this is achieved, the spaceport will
catch your fighter craft. Rearming and repairing aboard the spaceport is much faster than on a planet surface.<h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Cannon</h3>The standard energy weapon supplied by the same power plant that drives
 a spacecraft's propulsion system.
 <code>Damage: 1 per hit</code>
 <h3>Heavy Cannon</h3>Focusing the emitters of the standard cannon allowed us to create a weapon that 
delivers twice the energy per projectile.
<code>Damage: 2 per hit</code>
<br /><h3>Cluster Rocket</h3>Packed with explosive shells, this unguided rocket can deliver a bundle of 20
to the recipient for maximum destruction.
<code>Damage: 1 per hit x 20 shells + 0.5 impact damage</code>
 <br /><h3>Homing Missile</h3>We have refined a biological seeking intelligence
that is installed into every mass-produced homing missile: a highly destructive weapon.
Ensure your targeting system has locked onto an enemy before firing.
<code>Damage: 6 per hit</code><pre class="code poetry"></pre><h3>Laser Bolt</h3>Fast discharge ultra-capacitors have enabled our technicians to build a devastating laser weapon
into a small space.
<code>Damage: 30 per hit, ranged</code> <h2>Units</h2><h3>Fighter</h3><img src="fighter.png" alt="1"><br />The backbone of an offensive fighting force is the standard GHX-12 Fighter
craft armed with a rapid-fire cannon. Fighters can lay claim to unoccupied
planets.<br /><pre class="code ">Speed           ||||||||||

They carry the capability to speed up construction of essential 
fortifications and facilities. Freighters are the only craft capable of constructing
a Planetary Base (PBase).<br /><pre class="code ">Speed           ||........

They are used primarily to enforce claims on a hostile planet. Weak individually, fleets of these
ships are deadly en masse.<br /><pre class="code ">Speed           |.........

It can harvest and store raw materials on the planet. It can construct a Communications
Center and a Planetary Lab. It also provides defensive weapons, allowing the planet to 
defend itself from attackers. <br /><pre class="code ">Speed           ..........

materials from raw materials. It can construct spacecraft and other facilities; its operation
is critical to the maintenance demands of a planet. <br /><pre class="code ">Speed           ..........

empires to track precise locations of other worlds. A galactic radar display is
active when your faction owns at least one functional PComm.<br /><pre class="code ">Speed           ..........
